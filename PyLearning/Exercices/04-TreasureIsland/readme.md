I Learned a lot of stuff :

- Use of ANSI colors to enhance printed text
- How to clear lines in the terminal
- How to validate user input (checking for correct characters)
- Writing a large if-statement structure to manage the game progression
- Implementing a replay system using a while True loop

**Summary**

Treasure Island was the first game I truly enjoyed writing.
- I learned a lot from it, including:
- Loops
- The random module
- ANSI color formatting
- Input validation functions

This project helped me build a solid foundation for future ones, such as Rock Paper Scissors.
