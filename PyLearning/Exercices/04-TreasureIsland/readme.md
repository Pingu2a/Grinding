For Treasure Island, It was the first exercice I did a lot of stuff.

- I Learned about ANSI colors to add in my print
- I learned how to clean a line
- I learned how to check if the user type the good char in the input
- For the main function, it was an if forest lol so quite easy to doo
- I learned at the end how to play again a game with a "while True" loop


It was the first game I really enjoyed to write and learned a lot (loops, random module, ANSI colors, function checker)
