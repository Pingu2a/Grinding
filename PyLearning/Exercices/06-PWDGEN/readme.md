For this exercice, I needed to do an easy password generator. But I wanted to test more !

**Base**

- Created lists with letters, numbers and symbols
- 3 inputs for the user
- for forest to do the logic and to add letters, numbers and symbols into a empty list
- Then I used `shuffle`to have a real password

**Added**

That was easy so I wanted to encrypt the password and ask the user if he want to see his pwd decrypted.

- Added 2 functions (isXOR for XOR encryption, encrypt to encrypt my pwd)
- Encrypted the password and show to the user the encrypted password
- Finaly I added a small bloc with an input to ask if user want to see the real password. So I did an if condition to do this.

This exercice was funny and I added the encryption cuz I learned a bit this before and wanted to add in this little exercice
