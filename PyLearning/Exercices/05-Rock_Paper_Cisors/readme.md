I wanted to display real hand shapes, so I searched for graphic representations of rock, paper, and scissors and stored them in a list.

**Game Logic**

I implemented:
- User input handling
- Randomized computer choice
- An if/else structure to determine the outcome (Win, Lose, Draw)

**Input Validation**

I created a function to ensure the user types a valid number (0, 1, or 2).
If the input is invalid, the program asks again until a correct value is entered.

**ANSI Colors**

To make the game more visually appealing, I reused the ANSI colors I previously implemented in my Treasure Island project.

**Replay System**

Just like in Treasure Island, I added a replay option using a simple:

while True:

This allows the user to choose whether to play again.

**Win Rate Tracking**

The last feature I added was a win rate calculator for the player.
I expected it to be difficult, but it was actually quite easy and enjoyable to implement.
