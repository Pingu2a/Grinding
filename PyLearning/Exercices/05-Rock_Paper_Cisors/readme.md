The Rock Paper Cisors game was the best game to play. I really loved to code it ! 

First, I wanted to show real hand so I searched for graphic rock, paper, cisors with hands and stored these in a list.

I did the main logix like user choice and randomize the computer choie, then I did if else forest for the game logic (Win, Loose, draw).

After this, I did a function to check if the used type the rights digits (0, 1 or 2). If he doesn't it will ask again to put the correct number

I wanted to add color in my print so I took ANSI colors from my Treasure Island game.

I wanted the same logic as Treasure Island, I wanted to choose if I want to play again or not. So I did it with a While True and a small input and condition.

The last funny thing I wanted to add a winrate for the user so i was the last thing I did in this exercice.

I thought the winrate would be hard but it was quite easy and funny to do !
